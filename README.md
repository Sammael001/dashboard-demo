## Office Dashboard (demo version)

This is a live demo of the app suite I built for my current employer, to help resolve issues with inter-office communications and logistics in our Customer Care department.
The production version of this app suite is used daily by the Customer Care department, and includes the following:
- An app to track warehouse inventory
- An app to share inter-office memos and policy updates
- An app to locate internal sales representatives by state, province or country
- An app to identify part numbers by product serial number

The suite uses EJS templates, NodeJS/Express for server-side scripting, MongoDB/Mongoose for database operations, and PassportJS for secure user authentication and serialization.
