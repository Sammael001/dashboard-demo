SALES:
states, provinces and countries have a format like shown:
states: [
  { name: "Please select", region: "" },
  { name: "New York", region: "New York|Northeast" },
  { name: "Maine", region: "Maine|Northeast" },
  { name: "Texas", region: "Texas|Southwest" }
]

loop through each array (states, provinces or countries) and display each state.name as an input select name, but set the value as the state.region:
<select class="sales-select" name="stateChosen" required>
  <% states.forEach(state => { %>
      <option class="" value="<%= state.region %>">
      <%= state.name %>
    </option>
  <% }); %>
</select>

the region gets posted to sales/search as shown: "Maine|Northeast"
parse the region from this string and use it to query a list of regions in the database
let [myState, myRegion] = req.body.region.split("|");
