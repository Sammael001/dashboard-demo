Hello,

Adella told me about her living room accomodations, and I assumed the same would be true for our upcoming visit. No worries, and no apologies needed! We've slept on hotel floors at conventions before, and from what Adella describes the air mattress was very comfortable. 

I'm not sure how an animal Buster's size is supposed to tackle a rabbit or badger, but it's good to hear that his instincts remain intact under certain circumstances. For all that Maki is much more easygoing than Stormy, she's also much more rambunctious. Like all cats, every now and then she goes a little crazy and has to run in circles around the room and knock things over. She also meows very strangely sometimes: at loud volume, like a yowl, but clipped off very short. Adella thinks she is trying to bark.

Just yesterday Maki was running one of her marathons and I laughed at her. At this insult, she jumped up on the coffee table, stood up on her hind legs, looked straight at me and did one of those short yowls. Standing up and yowling like that, she looked so anthropomorphic -- like a tiny person who'd just been gravely insulted and was telling me off -- that I burst out laughing. This was probably not the response she was going for, I imagine, but I've never seen a cat do that. 

I learned something new today, I've legitimately never heard of 'transqueer'. Got to brush up on my gender studies apparently! Transgender women who are exclusively attracted to women often call themselves 'transbians', a portmaneau of 'transgender' and 'lesbian'. The term "queer" itself is interesting -- at one point it achieved the status of a slur, but now it's been reclaimed (though you'll still run into those who are adamantly against the word) and expanded to a sort of catchall term that encompasses "anything other than straight". That's why the 'Q' in LGBTQ is sometimes taken to mean "queer" -- it covers the edge cases who don't fit into Lesbian, Gay, Bi or Transgender. 

I have never had any tolerance for spicy foods, and that certainly hasn't changed as I age! :P I make an exception for wasabi, which only burns for a few seconds. The corn salsa at Chipotle is the best one, in our opinion. 

Here's a video of a man's haircut technique that I will probably try for Dad, unless he has strong preferences otherwise. Please keep in mind that the fellow in the video has a strong side part, and I do imagine that this guy's hair is longer on top than Dad would like.
