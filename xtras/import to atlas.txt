TO IMPORT JSON DATA INTO MONGODB ATLAS:

* Note: You can save excel worksheets as .csv and then convert .csv to .json on a site like https://www.csvjson.com/csv2json
* NOTE: Make sure the column names in the .csv file have the correct property names from your mongoose model!

* Initially ran into a bug with Inventory.find() returning null -- issue was that the schema for the Inventory model didn't match the data in the collection.
* to resolve, modified the Model in Inventory.js >> const Inventory = mongoose.model("Inventory", inventorySchema, "fixedinventory");
      // (model name, schema name, collection name)
* also modified JSON file >> "itemNum": "119738600"   .... before it was "itemNum": 119738600
    // this was probably the issue: itemNum was a String in the Model, but an integer in the DB
    // did this by unchecking "parse numbers" and "parse JSON" on https://www.csvjson.com/csv2json

1) In MongoDB Atlas, go to your Cluster > Overview
2) Click the Primary Cluster
3) Copy the address (ex: cluster0-shard-00-02-cfetv.mongodb.net:27017)
4) Create command string like so:

./mongoimport --host <address-of-your-cluster> --db <nameOfDbToCopyInto --type json --file <yourImportFileName.json> --jsonArray --authenticationDatabase admin --ssl --username <mongoDbAtlasUsername> --password <mongoDbAtlasPassword>

* Note: "--authenticationDatabase admin --ssl" are default settings for this command

Example:

./mongoimport --host cluster0-shard-00-02-cfetv.mongodb.net:27017 --db fruDB --type json --file parts.json --jsonArray --authenticationDatabase admin --ssl --username NewAdmin --password UEclm0ebsRBtmGXU

5) Navigate to directory where mongo.exe and mongoimport.exe lives (ex: C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\4.2\bin\)
6) copy and paste your JSON file into this same folder
7) open a bash terminal in this directory
8) run the command string in the bash terminal

* Note: your new collection will be named "yourImportFileName"
* NOTE: remember to update your Inventory model to reflect the new collection name!

** NOTE: if receiving error "Failed: (NotMaster) not master", check Step 3 and ensure you are on the PRIMARY cluster! Apparently this address changes from time to time. This failure indicates "replica sets must run on the master node", whatever that means



    COMPRESS COLLECTION BY QUANTITY AND RE-IMPORT DATA TO DB:

1) first, search the excel spreadsheet to make sure it contains no double quotes (") anywhere in any field
    * Item # 696-0024-05-001 was the only one I found today, had " in the description
2) upload this data to your DB by following the steps above (save spreadsheet as .csv, convert to .json, upload via bash terminal)
3) run an inventory report by navigating to the /report route
    * this generates a quantity-compressed list of all products in the database in JSON format
4) copy the contents of the report page, save as a new .json document in atom, and run delete-whitelines to tidy it up
5) check formatting of your JSON document on https://jsonformatter.org/
    * make sure data is enclosed in {}, no double quotes ("), trailing comma removed from last object, etc.
6) upload to DB again via the above steps
